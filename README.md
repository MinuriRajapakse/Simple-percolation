# Simple-percolation
Python program to demonstrate a very simple percolation process

## Steps
1. Download the zip file or clone this repository into your machine.
2. Make sure you have installed prettytable.
3. Run the code in your command prompt or open the terminal in your IDE.
4. Then enter "python mainperc.py", this will create a 5x5 grid (default size).
5. If you want to create a grid with different dimensions, enter "python mainperc.py rowsxcols"
   
   Ex: python mainperc.py 3x6

(This python code has been created so that the lowest dimenion is 3x3 and highest dimension is 9x9)

### The python code will now generate the grid with 2 digit random numbers and empty cells.
### The last row of the grid will display "OK" if the percolation is possible and "NO" if percolation is not possible.
### This will also record the result in a text file and a html file.
